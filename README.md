A command line tool for reviewing and executing AWS CloudFormation change sets.

## Features

* Read CloudFormation change set ARN from stdin or from the command line
* Print a summary of changes to stack resources, parameters and tags
* View the chain of causes that leads to resource changes (experimental)
* Review changes and execute them right away

## Installation
```
npm i -g cfn-execute-change-set
```

## Usage

To review and execute a changeset, just pipe the output of the AWS CLI
`create-change-set` command to the `cfn-execute-change-set` tool:

```
aws cloudformation create-change-set [...] | cfn-execute-change-set
```

Piping the output of `aws cloudformation deploy --no-execute-change-set` is
also supported.

Alternatively, you can provide a CloudFormation change set ARNs as command line
argument:

```bash
cfn-execute-change-set \
    arn:aws:cloudformation:eu-west-1:123456789123:changeSet/test-1516522726/9957ed5e-0049-4144-bc82-962941d972e4
```

### Example
```
$ aws cloudformation create-change-set [] | cfn-execute-change-set
{
    "StackId": "arn:aws:cloudformation:eu-west-1:748888633826:stack/ew1-test/e0496e10-fe10-11e7-8420-50fae9b818d2",
    "Id": "arn:aws:cloudformation:eu-west-1:748888633826:changeSet/test-1516540773/0e3d729c-9712-43aa-a7d3-2b44e4d2b797"
}

```

## Development

### Integration Test

The test suite includes an integration test that calls live AWS APIs. The integration test requires
valid AWS credentials that are allowed to
* Create, Describe and Delete CloudFormation stacks
* Create and Describe change sets
* Create, Delete and Update SNS topics (used as sample resource)

If the AWS SDK cannot find valid AWS credentials, the integration test is skipped. If the SDK finds
credentials which cannot perform these operations, the integration test will fail.

### Ideas
* Support change sets that import resources.
